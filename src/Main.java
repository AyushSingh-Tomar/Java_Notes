      KNOW HOW TO optimize algorithm
 c> SPACE COMPLEXITY
    i> tell me space complexity of the algo you used.
 d> STACK
   -> diff categories of ques he will give
 e> QUEUE
 f> LINKED LIST
 ----------- can be skipped but try ques--------------
 g> TREE
 h> GRAPH
 i> Sorting and searching, no direct question ,mug up algo, can be asked in interview, can be asked to write
 j> Approach
   a> Backtracking
   b> recursive
   d> Greedy
   e> Dynamic programming
   f>
